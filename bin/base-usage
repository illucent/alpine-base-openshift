This image serves as the base image for all Alpine Linux-based S2I builder images.
It provides all essential libraries and development tools needed to successfully build and
run an application. If additional packages are needed, use 'apk add' from your image.

To use this image as a base image, you need to have an 's2i/bin' directory in the same
directory as your S2I image Dockerfile. This directory should contain S2I scripts.

This base image also provides the default user you should use to run your application.
Your Dockerfile should include the 'USER default' instruction after you finish installing
software.

The default directory for installing your application sources is '/opt/app-root/src' and the
WORKDIR and HOME for the 'default' user is set to this directory as well. In your S2I scripts, you
don't have to use absolute paths, but rather rely on the relative path.
